Hi there!


--Changes made form video--
I made a two changes after the video so it would look just a bit better

1. Set the default visibility for the images to hidden to remove weird black dots that appeared
2. Added media queries to change the amount of columns from 5 to 3 then 2 and lastly 1 depending on screen size
